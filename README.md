# Pointers-in-C

Hello fellow students of C! The following commits come from my study of Stephen G. Kochan's "Programming in C." C is the language I have decided to dive the deepest in as an initial foray into computer programming. Most of the book settled in my mind like you would think, slow and sure with some difficulty, but for the most part with time and dedication I was able to overcome and grasp some semblance of comfort with the language. For whatever reason Chapter 10 (I have the 4th edition), pointers, linked lists, etc, has proven to be a sticking point. 

My goal with this series of commits is to type the code from the book and provide my own explanation in the notes, putting Kochan's words into my own and making them public, thus holding me accountable and possibly attracting the attention of people wiser and more experienced than myself to provide input. I will include the exercises at the end of the chapter and a little explanation of how I came to the solutions I provide.

Also, this will familiarize myself with the process and culture of git/github, an essential part of my education.
